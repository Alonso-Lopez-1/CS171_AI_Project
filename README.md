# CS171_AI_Project
Welcome to the AI Minesweeper Solver project! This repository contains a smart AI designed to solve the classic Minesweeper game. The solver uses advanced algorithms to make decisions and efficiently uncover the game board.

# Features
- Smart Decision-Making: The AI evaluates the board and makes strategic moves to minimize the risk of triggering mines.
- Frontier Management: It intelligently manages a frontier of uncovered cells to improve decision accuracy.
- Safe Move Prioritization: The AI prioritizes safe moves, flagging mines and uncovering cells based on calculated probabilities.
- Random Move Layer: When no certain moves are available, the AI employs a random selection strategy with minimized risk.

# Report
